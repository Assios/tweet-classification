<h3 class="tweet-center">Try to classify the tweets on a positive/neutral/negative scale to the best of your ability. A tweet that seems like it could be written on Wikipedia or in a newspaper is neutral, even though the content is positive. Here is an example of a neutral tweet (#18):"Fed's Bullard: 5% Jobbless Rate Is Close To Full Employment."</h3>
